Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and early detection plays a crucial role in improving survival rates. In this project, we aim to predict the presence of lung cancer using CT scan images of lung nodules. The dataset consists of CT images, which are processed and analyzed using machine learning models. We apply models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, and a Hard Voting Classifier to classify the nodules as benign or malignant. A Label Encoder is used to convert categorical labels into numerical format for model training. The goal is to develop an automated system that can assist healthcare professionals in early lung cancer detection, leading to better patient outcomes.
